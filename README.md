# Netflix_Stocks_Capstone-Project
seaborn library

This project had me work with seaborn and matplotlib libraries. Some of the visualizations I created in this project were: distribution of stock prices for past year, Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters, actual vs. estimated earnings per share for four quarters in 2017, and comparison of Netflix Stock price vs. Dow Jones Industrial average price in 2017.
